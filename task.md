# claude-trace-html-logs
**Status:** Refining
**Agent PID:** 12345

## Original Todo
apps/claude-trace This does not produce any logs in the .html, but the .jsonl has the data. See .claude-trace/log-2025-07-16-20-08-23.jsonl and .claude-trace/log-2025-07-16-20-08-23.html

## Description
Investigate and fix the issue where claude-trace HTML output does not display logs that exist in the JSONL format. Need to ensure logs are visible in the HTML output.

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Investigate HTML generator code in claude-trace/src/html-generator.ts
- [ ] Check JSONL processing in claude-trace/src/shared-conversation-processor.ts
- [ ] Identify why logs don't appear in HTML
- [ ] Fix HTML generation to include logs
- [ ] Test with sample data to verify logs appear
